      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Bubble Under is a group of diving enthusiasts based in the south-west
        UK who meet up for diving trips in the summer months when the weather is
        good and the bacon rolls are flowing. We arrange weekends away as small
        groups to cut the costs of accommodation and travel and to ensure that
        everyone gets a trustworthy dive buddy.</p>
      <p>Although we're based in the south-west, we don't stay on our own turf:
        past diving weekends away have included trips up to Scapa Flow in
        Scotland and to Malta's numerous wreck sites.</p>
      <p>When we're not diving, we often meet up in a local pub to talk about
        our recent adventures (any excuse, eh?).</p>
